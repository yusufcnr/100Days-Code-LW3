# 100Days-Code-LW3
This repository is used for the 100 days no break coding challenge with LW3.  

InÄ±tial Plan:  
My goal for this challange will be to learn more about full stack web3 development. I will continue my learning with this challenge.  Then I will look at Python, Shell scripting and databases.  
  
I am planning to study at least 3-4 hours per day if something big does not happen.  
  
I will go over html, css, js, react and solidity and build projects using them.  
  
Near to the end I am planning to study pyhton and shell scripting in order to use it for the web3 and my current work.  

My basic plan is below but something takes longer than plan and something else takes shorter. Main goal is take no day off and continue to code everyday. 
  
I wish luck, consistency and power for everyone who is participating.
