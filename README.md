# 100Days-Code-LW3
This repository is used for the 100 days no break coding challenge with LW3. 

InÄ±tial Plan:
My goal for this challange will be to learn more about full stack web3 development. I will continue my learning with this challenge. 
I am planning to study at least 4 hours per day if something big does not happen.
I will go over html, css, js, react and solidity and build projects using them. 
Near to the end I am planning to study pyhton and shell scripting in order to use it for the web3 and my current work. 

My basic plan is below but something takes longer than plan and something else takes shorter. Main goal is take no day off and continue to code everyday. 
I wish luck, consistency and power for every one participating. 

00-01 -> write an article for @scdevstr. // One of the biggest Turkish web3 development community. 
01-15 -> Deep dive into solidity and complete analyze and understand the smart contract parts on LW3 tracks, Alchemy, Crypto Zombies etc. as much Solidity as possible...
15-25 -> go over again html and css 
25-40 -> go over again vanilla js, finish Alchemy js fundamentals and 5 projects.
40-55 -> study react, complete 3 react (easy, medium, challanging)
55-70 -> complete LW3 dapps' frontend parts and submit and grduate tracks and learn more about web3 framworks.
70-80 -> Dive into smart contract security and learn abput auditing basics.
80-95 -> Python and shell scripting (this may change if I need more time for others)
