FreeCodeCamp-Javascript 
DAY1
---
Day 1 of 100DaysofCodeLW3 I started FreeCodeCamp Javascript tutorials. I will be doing it for one month. 
Today I have gone over varialbes and declaration of them. 
I have learnd:
Different variable types:
Different between const, var and let keyword when declaring a variable.

if you use var to declare a varialbe you can overwrite it easily and you do not get an error which makes finding the bugs difficult.
you can use let keyword for declaration so if you try to overwrite the variable with another value it throws an error so you can follow it easily. 
If you declare a variable with const it cannot be changed. It is readonly. 

See you tomorrow. 

------
Difference between a =+ b and a +=b 
If you use - instead of + you can understan better one of them is increment/decrement and one of them is value assingment. 
x = +10 actually no diferent than x = -10 in terms of declaration

use \"SOME string in string \*

"----" === '----'
