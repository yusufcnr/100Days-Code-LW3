const [a, b] = c;

const {x, y} = z;

for array destructuring we can use anything as parameter.
a and b can be any variable.

but for the object destructuring we need to use exact properties of the object.
in our example x and y need to be properties of the z.

but if you want to use your varibles we can do it like this:

const { name: catName, sound: catSound } = cat;

for default values:

const {name = "tekir", sound ="mmmmmiav" } = cat;

for nested objects:

const animals = [
  { name: "cat", sound: "meow" },
  {
    name: "dog", sound: "woof",
    feedingRequirements: {
      food: 3,
      water:2,
    
  }}
];

const {name, sound, feedingRequirements:{food, water}} = cat;
