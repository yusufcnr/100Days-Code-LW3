This is for the first 30 days coding challenge with LW3.  
  
First 30 days I will be focusing on html, css and vanilla javascript. 
    
I will be doing this course for javascript: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript  
  
I will document my progres on my twitter page: https://twitter.com/yc_crypto
